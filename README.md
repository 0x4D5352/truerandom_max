# truerandom_max
A simple true-randomness device built in Max 8, using random.org's true randonmess generator!

Requires an internet connection to work.

To install, just download the zip file and place the .maxpat file inside whatever directory you keep your third-party Max Abstractions, such as your user/Documents/Max 8/Library folder, or a custom location added from the File Preferences.

Once installed, simply load it as you would any other max object!

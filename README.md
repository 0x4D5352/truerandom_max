# truerandom_max
A simple true-randomness device built in Max 8, using random.org's true randonmess generator!

Requires an internet connection to work.

Abstraction (.maxpat):
To install, just download the zip file and place the .maxpat file inside whatever directory you keep your third-party Max Abstractions, such as your user/Documents/Max 8/Library folder, or a custom location added from the File Preferences.

Ableton Live Max Audio Effect (.amxd):
If you have Ableton Live Suite, you can place the .amxd file in whatever directory you keep your third party max for live devices, such as your User Library or a custom location added in the browser.

Once installed, simply load it as you would any other max object!
